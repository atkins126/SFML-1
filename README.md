# SFML
### Simple Fast Multimedia Layer

Bindings that allow you to use **SFML** and other useful C libraries with Pascal. 

### Included
- **CSFML** (https://github.com/SFML/CSFML)
- **pl_mpeg** (https://github.com/phoboslab/pl_mpeg)
- **Nuklear** (https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear)
- **physfs** (https://github.com/icculus/physfs)
- **minizip** (https://github.com/madler/zlib)
- **SDL** (https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL)

### Minimum Requirements 
- Windows 10+ (64 bits)
- <a href="https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter" target="_blank">Delphi Community Edition</a> (Win64 target only)
- <a href="https://freepascal.org" target="_blank">FreePascal</a> 3.2.2 (Win64 target only)


## How to use in Delphi/FreePascal
- Unzip the archive to a desired location.
- Add `installdir\sources`, folder to Delphi's library path so the SFML binding files can be found for any project or for a specific project add to its search path.
- Add `installdir\bin`, folder to Windows path so that SFML.dll can be found for any project or place beside project executable.
- Add `SFML` to your uses section to access all the aforementioned libraries.
- You link to SFML dynamically by default and will look for the SFML.dll in your application path. You can also call `InitSFML`, before any other routines, with a path to the DLL location.
- Define `SFML_STATIC` in `SFML.pas` to statically link to SFML and the DLL will not have to be included in your application distro. `InitSFML` will have no effect and you can leave it in your sources so that you can switch between static and dynamic linking during development.
- You must include **SFML.dll** in your project distribution when using dynamic linking.
- See the examples in `installdir\examples` folder for more information on usage. Load `SFML Projects.groupproj` to load and run the examples in Delphi. For **FPC**, you can compile a project using **fp64.bat** and run it using **run.bat**. For example `fp64 window` then `run window` from the command-line.

### Minimal Example

```Pascal
uses
  SysUtils,
  SFML;

var
  Mode: sfVideoMode;
  Window: PsfRenderWindow;
  Event: sfEvent;
  Music: PsfMusic;
  
begin
  Mode.Width := 800;
  Mode.Height := 600;
  Mode.BitsPerPixel := 32;
  
  Window := sfRenderWindow_create(Mode, 'Hello SFML', sfResize or sfClose, nil);

  Music := sfMusic_createFromFile('arc/audio/music/song01.ogg');
  sfMusic_play(Music);

  while sfRenderWindow_isOpen(Window) = sfTrue do
  begin
    while sfRenderWindow_pollEvent(Window, @Event) = sfTrue do
    begin
      if Event.kind = sfEvtClosed then
        sfRenderWindow_close(Window);
    end;

    sfRenderWindow_clear(Window, DARKSLATEBROWN);
    sfRenderWindow_display(Window);
  end;

  sfMusic_stop(Music);
  sfMusic_destroy(Music);
  sfRenderWindow_destroy(Window);
end.
```
